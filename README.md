# Engal Sandhai  

**Engal Sandhai** is a **web-based, intranet-only billing and realtime stock management system** built for a college campus vegetable store.  
It connects **faculty buyers (~300 daily active users)** with **admin faculty (5 users)** who manage daily stock and prices.  
The system generates bills, accepts static-QR-based payments (faculty upload payment screenshots), decrements stock **atomically**, and provides realtime stock updates across connected clients.
